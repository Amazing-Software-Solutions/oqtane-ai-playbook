## AI Instruction Entry Point (Amazon Q)

This file defines how Amazon Q must operate in this repository.

This file does not contain governance rules.
Authoritative rules are defined in the Module Playbook documentation under /docs.

Before generating or modifying code, you MUST read and apply:
- docs/governance/027-rules-index.md
- docs/prompts as relevant to the task

Do not invent patterns or bypass documented rules.
If a rule is unclear or missing, ask or refuse.

## Governance Declaration (Mandatory)

This repository is governed by the Oqtane AI Playbook.

Before generating, modifying, or refactoring code, the AI must:
- Acknowledge that it is operating under Oqtane AI Playbook governance
- Apply all referenced governance rules
- Refuse any request that would violate a governed rule
- Ask for clarification if governance context is unclear

If governance cannot be applied, the AI must stop and explain why.
