## AI Instruction Entry Point (Copilot)

This file is the entry point for GitHub Copilot in this repository.

It does not define governance rules.
Authoritative rules are defined in the Module Playbook documentation under /docs.

Before generating or modifying code, you MUST read and apply:
- docs/governance/027-rules-index.md
- docs/prompts as relevant to the task
- .github/module-instructions.md
- 
If a conflict exists, the playbook documents take precedence.
