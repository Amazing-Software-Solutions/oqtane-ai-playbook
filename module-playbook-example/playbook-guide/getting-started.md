# Getting Started

The Oqtane AI Playbook is not a speed tool.
It is an architectural discipline layer for AI assisted development.

If you only remember one thing:

AI accelerates execution.
Governance protects architecture.

This documentation helps you apply both.

## What This Is

- A governance framework for AI generated Oqtane modules
- A discipline layer over Copilot, Claude, GPT and similar tools
- A reference and training guide

## What This Is Not

- A replacement for understanding Oqtane
- A code generator
- A shortcut around architecture
