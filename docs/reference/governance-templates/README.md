# Governance Templates

This folder contains **starter templates** for module repositories.

These files are intended to be:
- Copied into a module repository
- Customized locally
- Used as governance glue for AI tools

---

## Important Distinction

Templates are **not canonical references**.

Canonical validation is always performed against:
- The Oqtane Framework source
- Enforced governance rules (`027x-*`)

Templates exist to accelerate adoption, not define truth.
