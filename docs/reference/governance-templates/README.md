# Governance Templates

This folder contains **canonical governance templates** used by the
Oqtane AI Playbook.

These files are intended to be **copied verbatim** into individual
module repositories and then customized only where explicitly allowed.

## Files

- `copilot-instructions.md`  
  Defines enforceable AI behavior and rejection rules.

- `ai-decision-timeline.md`  
  Records non-trivial AI-assisted decisions and refusals.

- `deviations.md`  
  Documents intentional departures from canonical rules.

## Rules

- Do not weaken these templates
- Do not rename files
- Do not merge them together
- Do not remove enforcement language

If your local versions differ materially, the difference must be
recorded in `deviations.md`
