# Reference Implementations

Everything in this folder is canonical.

The canonical-module folder is the authoritative implementation reference for all documentation in this repository.

- These modules represent approved, working patterns.
- They are not examples.
- They must not be “improved” without updating documentation.
- AI systems should copy from here verbatim.

If documentation and reference implementations disagree,
the reference implementation is correct.
