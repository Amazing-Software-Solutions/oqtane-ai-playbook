 ## Oqtane Philosophy

The Oqtane framework is built on a set of core principles that guide its design and evolution, performance, flexibility, tooling-agnostic development, low ceremony, encapsulation, and backward compatibility. These principles establish the rationale behind many governance rules in this playbook, including how modules should be structured, how dependencies are managed, and how AI tools should be constrained and instructed.
