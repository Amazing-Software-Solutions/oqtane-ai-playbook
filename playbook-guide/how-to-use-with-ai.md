# Using This Playbook With AI

Before prompting AI:

1. Be clear about the problem.
2. Know which rule category applies.
3. Decide if this is architectural or implementation level.

When AI responds:

- Confirm it acknowledges governance.
- Confirm it follows migration version rules.
- Confirm hosting parity is preserved.
- Confirm RevisionNumber alignment.
- Confirm no unnecessary JavaScript was introduced.
- Confirm CSS rules are followed.

AI must not act autonomously on migrations or versioning without confirmation.
