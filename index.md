> **This playbook aligns with the core principles of Oqtane as articulated in the Oqtane Philosophy — performance, flexibility, low ceremony, tool agnosticism, consistency, and practical simplicity.**

---

## Overview

The **Oqtane AI Playbook** is a framework-aware governance repository for building robust, upgrade-safe Oqtane modules - with or without AI assistance. This repository makes Oqtane's implicit rules explicit, ensuring AI tools behave as force multipliers, not chaos agents.

**TL;DR for maintainers**: This repository defines **non-negotiable architectural and AI governance rules** for Oqtane module development. If AI-generated output conflicts with this playbook, the AI is wrong.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Governance Model
This repository follows a three-layer governance hierarchy:

1. **Authoring Layer** - The Oqtane AI Playbook defines governance rules, patterns, and constraints
2. **Reference Layer** - Playbook.Module.GovernedExample demonstrates implementation in practice  
3. **Application Layer** - Real modules build features by following the example module

### Authority Order
When conflicts arise, authority is resolved in this order:
1. Canonical reference module
2. Playbook documentation (`/docs`)
3. Oqtane framework constraints
4. AI-generated output (always last)

### Required Files for AI Governance
When adopting this playbook, the following files must exist and be visible to AI tools:
```
.github/
├── copilot-instructions.md

docs/
├── governance/
│   ├── 027-rules-index.md
│   └── 027x-*.md (rule files)
├── ai-decision-timeline.md
└── deviations.md
```

## 🤖 Auto-Generation Info

This `index.md` file is **automatically generated** by GitHub Actions whenever:
- Files in the `docs/` directory change
- Root markdown files change  
- Workflow is manually triggered

**⚠️ Do not manually edit this file** - your changes will be overwritten.

To update the index, modify the source files or edit the workflow in `.github/workflows/auto-index.yml`.

---

## 🚦 Quick Start

1. **Read the documentation** - Start with the numbered narrative in `/docs`
2. **Use as governance** - Reference in reviews and anchor AI tools to these rules
3. **Adopt incrementally** - Apply to new code first, align old code when touched

---

## 🛡️ Critical Rules

- **Never reference this playbook directly in module code**
- **Treat violations as hard failures, not suggestions**
- **AI must follow documented Oqtane patterns exactly**
- **Never introduce generic ASP.NET Core patterns without explicit reason**
- **Always validate against the canonical reference module**

---

## ℹ️ About

This repository exists because most Oqtane module failures are caused by:
- Generic .NET Core assumptions
- Hidden framework invariants  
- Multi-tenant misunderstandings
- AI-generated code that looks right but violates Oqtane rules
- Tribal knowledge that isn't written down

By making these rules explicit and enforceable, AI becomes a productivity multiplier rather than a risk amplifier.

---

## 🤝 Community

Contributions are welcome in the form of:
- Clarifications
- Corrections  
- Edge cases
- Additional chapters
- Real-world failures and lessons learned

The goal is **shared understanding**, not personal ownership.

---

*Frameworks don't fail. Tools don't fail. Developers don't fail. **Unspoken rules fail.***

This repository exists to speak them out loud.
